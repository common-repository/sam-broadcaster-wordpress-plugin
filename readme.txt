This is a plugin for SAM Broadcaster for Wordpress.

== Description ==

There was a serious lack of SAM Broadcaster Plugin that just simply works without making any changes.  So, I hope this is the beginning.  Do check out the Pro/Enterprise version that comes with a lot of bells and whistles.  For other information see http://samwordpressplugin.com.

== Installation ==

Install should be easy.  

1. Unzip the zip the file and upload the entire sam-broadcaster-wordpress-plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place shortcode `[sradiobfmnowplaying]` in your page where you would like to display "Now Playing"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to modify the database ? =

Nope

= I don't have a dedicate IP address to input for my SAM Broadcaster, what do I do ? =

Use dyn dns or many other similar services out there.  Dedicate host is not required but obviously, if you are broadcasting all the time and you want your users to see what your playing, it may be worth it to get something.dyndns.org, etc.
